# Halfedge Mesh data structure
This is a computer graphics project that uses interlinked pointers in C++ to create an interactive Halfedge Mesh data structure. It is rendered using OpenGL vertex buffers and a polar spherical camera. 
I implemented a GUI to perform various mesh topology editing operations real time, including splitting edges, face
triangulation, Catmull-Clark Subdivision, and extruding faces. I also created an interactive skeleton with transformable joints that can be bound to a meshâ€™s vertices to allow linear skin deformation.

Here are some images to showcase a few features: 

In this image I have loaded an OBJ file of a dodecahedron, rendered with Lambertian shading-

Here I extruded each face of the geometry-

This image shows the result of performing 3 iterations of Catmull-Clark Subdivision on the extruded dodecahedron-

This is an unaltered rendering of a cow, broken into polygons-

Here I have bound each vertex of the cow to joints (loaded from a JSON file) and manipulated joints to rotate the neck of the cow and its back leg-
